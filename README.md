# Introduction

In this book, I'll be adding all default Microsoft Sentinel alerts with explanation, impact and how to investigate each alert in order to conclude if it's a False Positivie or True Positive:



Each alert will contains the following details:

1. Explanation of the alert (why it triggers, how often etc...)
2. What IOCs we should look for&#x20;
3. How to look for these IOCs using Microsoft Defender
4. KQL query to extract relevant information for our investigation
